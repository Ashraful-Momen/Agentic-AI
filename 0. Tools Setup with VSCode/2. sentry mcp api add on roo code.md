what is the sentry ? 
-------------------
Here’s a **simple and clear explanation of Sentry in Roo Code**, with **key points**:

---

# ✅ **What is Sentry in Roo Code?**

In Roo Code, **Sentry** is an **error monitoring and tracking service** that helps you:

* Track all errors happening inside the Roo Code system
* Log API failures
* Detect server-side runtime problems
* Monitor performance and crashes
* Receive alerts when something goes wrong

Roo Code internally uses Sentry to provide **better debugging**, especially for MCP agents, extensions, and server-side workflows.

---

# ✅ **Why Sentry is Needed in Roo Code? (Key Points)**

### **1. Error Tracking**

Sentry automatically records:

* Exceptions
* Crashes
* Failed API calls
* Unexpected behavior

So developers can quickly identify the root cause.

---

### **2. Debugging Made Easy**

You get:

* Error location (file + line number)
* Stack trace
* Timestamp
* User context

This helps you fix issues faster.

---

### **3. Performance Monitoring**

Sentry shows:

* Slow operations
* Delay in API responses
* Bottlenecks in long-running tasks
* High latency MCP agent calls

This is very helpful for optimizing Roo Code workflows.

---

### **4. Alerts & Notifications**

If something breaks, Sentry sends alerts to:

* Email
* Slack
* Discord
* Other integrations

So you know instantly when the Roo system or agent errors happen.

---

### **5. Helps Track MCP Issues**

Since Roo Code depends on:

* AI agents
* API integrations
* Background automation

Sentry logs failures coming from:

* MCP configuration problems
* Permission issues
* Network/API connection failures
* Agent execution errors

---

# ✅ **How Sentry Works in Roo Code (Internal Flow)**

1. You add your **Sentry API key (DSN)** inside the Roo project.
2. The system initializes a Sentry Client.
3. Whenever an error happens:

   * Roo Code → sends the error to Sentry Cloud
4. You can login to your Sentry dashboard to see:

   * Error details
   * User info
   * Timeline
   * Impacted area

---

# 🔥 **One-Sentence Summary**

**Sentry in Roo Code is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring tool that logs crashes, alerts you instantly, and helps debug MCP + API workflow issues.**

---

Below is the **complete, step-by-step guide** to:

✅ Create a Sentry account
✅ Create a Sentry project
✅ Get the Sentry API key (DSN)
✅ Install Sentry in Roo Code
✅ Add the API key inside Roo Code (VSCode Roo Extension)

I’ll explain everything **very clearly**.

---

# 🚀 **1. Create Sentry Account**

1. Go to **[https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io)**
2. Click **Sign Up**
3. Create account using:

   * Email
   * Google login
   * GitHub login
4. Verify email
5. Log in to Sentry dashboard

---

# 🚀 **2. Create a Sentry Project**

1. Inside Sentry dashboard → click **Projects**
2. Click **Create Project**
3. Choose platform:

   * **JavaScript** (recommended for Roo Code)
4. Name the project:
   Example: `roo-code-monitoring`
5. Click **Create Project**

---

# 🚀 **3. Get the Sentry API Key (DSN)**

After creating the project, Sentry will show a code snippet like:

```
SENTRY_DSN = "https://xxxxx.ingest.sentry.io/yyyyy"
```

This is your **DSN (Data Source Name)** — basically the **Sentry API key**.

If you missed it:

* Go to **Project Settings**
* Go to **Client Keys (DSN)**
* Copy the **Public DSN**

Example DSN:

```
https://12345abcdef@sentry.io/98765
```

---

# 🚀 **4. Install Sentry in Roo Code**

### 🌟 Roo Code uses Node.js runtime behind MCP

So we install Sentry on your **workspace project** or **Roo agent code**.

If your project is Node.js:

```bash
npm install @sentry/node
```

If your project is browser-based:

```bash
npm install @sentry/browser
```

If you don't have a package.json, run:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then install Sentry.

---

# 🚀 **5. Add Sentry API Key in Roo Code**

### For Roo Code (VSCode) → Add DSN in **env.json** or **roo settings**

#### **Option 1: Add inside `.env` file**

Create or open `.env`:

```
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxxxx@sentry.io/yyyyy
```

---

### **Option 2: Add inside your Roo Agent code**

Example in Node.js:

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,   // track performance
});
```

---

### **Option 3: Add Sentry to Steps or MCP Agent**

Inside your agent main file:

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://xxxxx@sentry.io/yyyyy",
  integrations: [],
});
```

Then wrap your operations:

```js
try {
  // your roo code logic
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
  throw err;
}
```

Now every error will automatically go to Sentry.

---

# 🚀 **6. Add Sentry to Roo Code Settings (VSCode)**

1. Open **VSCode**
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Search: `Roo`
4. If there is a field like:
   → **Error Monitoring / Sentry DSN**
5. Paste your DSN

Some versions of Roo have a config file:

`roo.config.json`:

```json
{
  "sentry": {
    "dsn": "https://xxxxx@sentry.io/yyyyy"
  }
}
```

---

# 🚀 **7. Test Sentry**

Add this test error:

```js
Sentry.captureMessage("Roo Code Sentry test working!");
```

or:

```js
throw new Error("Testing Sentry with Roo Code");
```

Then check Sentry dashboard → Issues.

---

# 🎉 **DONE! Now your Roo Code is fully connected to Sentry.**
